## [2.0.1] - 2022-06-16

### Changed

- Extracted `KeycloakOauth::NotFoundError` and `KeycloakOauth::AuthorizableError` into separate file. When using Zeitwerk code loader in your main application, it was sometimes unable to find these classes.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-06-14

### Breaking

- To avoid confusion what kind of token will be requested from Keycloak, we renamed `KeycloakOauth::PostTokenService` to `KeycloakOauth::PostAuthorizationCodeService`.
- Rails' `default_url_options` are required to be configured.

### Added

- New service named `KeycloakOauth::PostRefreshTokenService` to request a new access token with a refresh token.
- Expiration of both the refresh and access token will be written to the session. You can retrieve them by calling `session[:access_token_expires_at]` or `session[:refresh_token_expires_at]` in your controller.

- The default redirection url for a successful login has been changed from `/` to the `root_path` of your app.
